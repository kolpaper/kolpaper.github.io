Graphics in games are refreshed automatically, but there is a process that is used to determine when the graphics should be refreshed. This process is called “redrawing.” In general, when the game needs to redraw some of its assets, it will do so using a function called “render.” There are a few factors that can affect how often this function will be run. For example, if the graphics card is underpowered or has low performance, then it may not be able to keep up with the request for resources from the game. Additionally, if there’s an active benchmark or other stress test running on the computer at the same time as your game, then this can also cause the render function to be slow down.\nIn general though, most games should redraw their graphics approximately every 2 hours (or sooner if there’s significant load on the system).\n","wordCount":"3487","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-06-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-06-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Zechariah O\u0026#039;Keefe"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://kolpaper.github.io/posts/sheep-dog-images/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"kolpaper","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://kolpaper.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://kolpaper.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://kolpaper.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://kolpaper.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://kolpaper.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://kolpaper.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://kolpaper.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Sheep Dog Images ~ Angry Sheep Dog Stock Image</h1><div class=post-description>Sheep herding dogs</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-06-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 8, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3487 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Zechariah O&amp;#039;Keefe</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#this-happy-dog-trapped-in-between-sheep>This Happy Dog Trapped In Between Sheep</a></li><li><a href=#sheep-dog---wikipedia>Sheep Dog - Wikipedia</a></li><li><a href=#sheep-dog-fun-international-sheep-dog-trials-2012>Sheep Dog Fun: International Sheep Dog Trials 2012</a></li><li><a href=#dog-attack-on-wicklow-sheep-farm-owner-refuses-to-put-dog-down---agriland>Dog Attack On Wicklow Sheep Farm, Owner Refuses To Put Dog Down - Agriland</a></li><li><a href=#what-dog-breed-walks-over-sheep---dog-discoveries>What Dog Breed Walks Over Sheep?

Graphics in games are refreshed automatically, but there is a process that is used to determine when the graphics should be refreshed. This process is called &ldquo;redrawing.&rdquo; In general, when the game needs to redraw some of its assets, it will do so using a function called &ldquo;render.&rdquo;
There are a few factors that can affect how often this function will be run. For example, if the graphics card is underpowered or has low performance, then it may not be able to keep up with the request for resources from the game. Additionally, if there&rsquo;s an active benchmark or other stress test running on the computer at the same time as your game, then this can also cause the render function to be slow down.</p><p>In general though, most games should redraw their graphics approximately every 2 hours (or sooner if there&rsquo;s significant load on the system).</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://kolpaper.github.io/tags/wallpaper-list/>Wallpaper List</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://kolpaper.github.io/posts/shark-background-wallpaper/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Shark Background Wallpaper - Moon Jellyfish Computer Desktop Backgrounds Free : Wallpapers13.com</span></a>
