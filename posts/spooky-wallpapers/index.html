Graphics in games are refreshed automatically, but there is a process that is used to determine when the graphics should be refreshed.

There are a few factors that can affect how often this function will be run. For example, if the graphics card is underpowered or has low performance, then it may not be able to keep up with the request for resources from the game. Additionally, if there&rsquo;s an active benchmark or other stress test running on the computer at the same time as your game, then this can also cause the render function to be slow down.</p><p>In general though, most games should redraw their graphics approximately every 2 hours (or sooner if there&rsquo;s significant load on the system).</p><h2 id=spooky-wallpapers---wallpaper-cave-1>Spooky Wallpapers - Wallpaper Cave<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#spooky-wallpapers---wallpaper-cave-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp4064061.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.IPnMnzVRycKxa-empBuOrgHaEK&pid=15.1"' alt="Spooky Wallpapers - Wallpaper Cave"><p><em>Source: wallpapercave.com</em></p><blockquote><p>spooky wallpapers.</p></blockquote><p>One of the most popular ways to show off your computer&rsquo;s hardware is by using a desktop wallpaper.
